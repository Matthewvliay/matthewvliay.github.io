				<p>
					Today, I was with my mother and sister heading out to go to the food bank in a nearby city. It's about a 15
					minute drive, and after we arrive, I notice that my left rear tire is flat, and I think, "Well, I could just
					go pump it after we're done at the nearby gas station," and move along. The line was long and boring, so I got
					frustrated(I'm pretty sure I have patient problems, but thats another story). We went in, got out, and as I'm
					driving, the tire just seems to sink flat so quickly that I wasn't sure I was going to make it to the gas
					station.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thankfully, we made it, but we didn't realize that the tire had an actual tear and the rim was quite dented,
					so it was panic time.
				</p>
				<p>
					My mother, sister, and I just stand there for about 5 minutes looking at it in despair, and out of the blue, a
					man in his 50s pulls up to the gas station for a couple of minutes, walks out of his car, and makes the effort
					to help us.

				<p>
					I want to keep it short for privacy reasons, but he ended up bringing us to get a new tire and paid for half
					the price(which I could hardly pay for). At this moment, a two new lights came shining through a crease of a
					closed door. The first one is there is good in the world, however selfish people may seem or be portrayed on
					the media. Second, allowing yourself to be open to new ideas, opinions, and other people's presence is
					essential to being successful in the real world. If you want to help and trust others, you must give them your
					trust and help first. It is only then you can be on the other side of the coin and help those in need such as
					I was today.
